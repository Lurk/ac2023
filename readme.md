# Advent of Code 2023 (code/notes)

Installation:

```shell
cargo install -git ac2023
```

## Day 1

`Off by one` errors everywhere. 

```shell
ac2023 first <path to input>
```

## Day 2

Initial idea of using `PartialOrd` to compare Round's was bad. 
Today we will have to different kinds of calculation fit and max. 


```shell
ac2023 second <path to input> fit
```

```shell
ac2023 second <path to input> max
```
